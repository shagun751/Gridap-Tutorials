# Gridap Notes

## Features

- Simplicity <br>
Weak form same as the paper in the code
- Automation <br>
You can compute derivatives, hence no need to define things like Jacobians. (I guess similar to Mathematica)

## Packages to be installed

- Gridap
- GridapGmsh <br> 
To import a mesh from Gmesh
- GridEmbedded <br>
Complex geometris embedded in backgroud grids.
- GridapODEs <br>
To solve ODEs I guess? <br>
This has been incorporated within Gridap package, so not necessary to get separately I think.
- GridapDistributed <br>
Solve on distributed computers (HPCE)
